 <font size="4"> They were huge in size and heavy in wieght.<br>
They emitted a large amount of heat because of the usage of thousands of vaccum tubes. <br>
They consumed more power and were very expensive. <br>
They used machine language which was cumbersome and machine-dependent.That is a program written for one computer could not be executed on another computer.
