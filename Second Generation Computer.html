<font size="4"> The second generation computers used transistors which were smaller and faster as well as consumed less power than vaccum tubes. ENIAC 1401; IBM 700 and CDC 160 are example of second generation computers. </font> <br> <p align="center"> <img src="Transistors.jpg"> </p>

<hr style="border-width: 5px; margin-right: 1300px; border-color: brown">
<font size="4">	These computers were smaller in size and less bulky as compared to the first generation computers. <br>
They generated lesser amount of heat than the first generation computes. <br>
They were faster and less expensive as compared to the first generation computers. </font> <br>
<font size="6">	<font color="brown"> Disadvantages </font>
<hr style="border-width: 5px; margin-right: 1200px; border-color: brown">
<font size="4"> They were still costly and constant maintenance was required. <br>
They required a cooling system. <br>
They used punched cards for input. <br>
They used assembly language which was also machine-dependent.
